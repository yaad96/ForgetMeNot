Privacy Policy for Never4Get

**Effective date:** 22nd August 2025

Never4Get is a personal travel planning app. This policy explains what data the app processes, why it is processed, and the choices you have. If you have questions, contact **yaadmainul@gmail.com**.

## Summary
* We do not run our own servers and we do not create user accounts.
* Plans, tasks, notes, and images are stored on your device in the app’s container.
* Voice audio and text you choose to process are sent to the OpenAI API to provide state of the art transcription and smart plan and task creation.
* Calendar and Reminders are read only. Only items you select are imported into a plan on your device.
* We do not sell your data. We do not use third party advertising SDKs.

## Data we process

### Audio recordings and transcripts
* **What:** Audio you record in the app and the transcript you approve.
* **Why:** To deliver smart voice transcription and to create a smart travel plan and tasks.
* **Where stored:** Audio is kept locally until it is sent to the OpenAI API for transcription if you choose that action. The resulting transcript is shown to you for review. The transcript you accept may be sent to the OpenAI API to generate a smart plan and tasks. Saved plans and tasks are stored on your device.
* **Retention:** Local items remain until you delete them or remove the app. OpenAI’s handling of your submitted content is governed by OpenAI’s terms and privacy policy.

### Calendar and Reminders
* **What:** Event titles, dates, times, locations, and reminder titles that you select.
* **Why:** To seed a smart travel plan or tasks.
* **Where stored:** Selected items are copied into a plan on your device. The app does not modify your calendars or reminders.
* **Retention:** Until you delete the plan or remove the app.

### Images and subject lift
* **What:** Photos you pick and the lifted subject produced by Apple’s VisionKit.
* **Why:** To attach images or lifted subjects to tasks so plans are clearer.
* **Where stored:** Images and lifted subjects are stored on your device. Subject lift runs on device using Apple frameworks.
* **Retention:** Until you delete the task, delete the plan, or remove the app.

### App diagnostics and analytics
* **What:** The app does not include third party analytics or crash reporting based on the code in this project.
* **Why:** Not applicable.
* **Where stored:** Not applicable.

## How processing works

### On device
* Plans, tasks, notes, and images are saved with Apple’s app storage on your device.
* Subject lift uses Apple VisionKit on device.
* You can create plans manually without sending any content to external services.

### With OpenAI API
* When you choose to transcribe audio, the audio is sent to the OpenAI API for transcription.
* When you choose to generate a plan or tasks from text, your text is sent to the OpenAI API to create structured output.
* OpenAI is a separate company. Its processing and retention are governed by its own terms and privacy policy. Review those documents to understand how they handle submitted content.

## Permissions the app requests
* **Microphone:** To record audio that you choose to transcribe.
* **Camera:** To capture photos you attach to tasks.
* **Photo Library:** To select photos to attach to tasks.
* **Calendars:** To read events that you choose to import into a plan.
* **Reminders:** To read reminders that you choose to import into a plan.

You can change these permissions at any time in iOS Settings.

## Your choices and controls
* Use manual planning at any time to avoid sending content to third parties.
* Review your transcript before generating a plan.
* Delete any plan, task, or image from within the app.
* Remove the app to delete all local data stored by the app on your device.

## Data security
Data is stored in the app’s container on your device. We rely on iOS protections provided by Apple. No method of storage is perfectly secure, but we design the app to limit data sharing and to keep processing local whenever possible.

**When you choose smart features:** your **voice audio** for transcription and any **event details you select from Calendar or Reminders** that you choose to turn into a smart plan may be **sent to the OpenAI API** to generate a smart travel plan and tasks. This processing is required to provide those smart features. Content you do not select or send remains on your device.

OpenAI is a separate company. Its processing and retention are governed by its own terms and privacy policy.


## International users
Processing may involve sending content to OpenAI when you choose to use transcription or smart plan creation. That processing may occur in servers outside your country depending on OpenAI’s infrastructure.

## Changes to this policy
We may update this policy as the app evolves. Material changes will be reflected in this document with a new effective date.
